## Recommendations

### First Review Recommendations

* **LOW IMPORTANCE** The event `Transfer(...)` in *Token* is a duplicate of `Transfer(...)` in *ERC20Basic* and should be removed
  * [x] Removed in [58152e4](https://github.com/Privatix/smart-contract/commit/58152e4759a61c86448008376345aa72bc3cd4c6)
* **MEDIUM IMPORTANCE** What is the `burn(...)` function for? It breaks the trustlessness of the token contract as the owner can destroy any
  account's token balance. The reply from the developer is that `burn(...)` is only for use by `Sale.refund(...)`.
  
  Replace `function burn(address from) onlyOwner returns (bool) {` with `function burn(address from) internal returns (bool) {` and this
  prevents the contract owner from directly executing the `burn(...)` function, but allows `Sale.refund(...)` to burn refunded tokens
  
  * [x] The developer has brought to my attention that the owner of the *Token* contract is the *Sale* contract, not the crowdsale contract
    owner, so this is not an issue. Also, the `internal` keyword change will prevent this function from working correctly, as the call
    is across contracts from *Sale* to *Token*
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** *Token* has the following statements `StandardToken.transferFrom(from, to, value);`, `BasicToken.transfer(to, value);`,
  `MintableToken.finishMinting();` and `MintableToken.mint(contributor, amount);`. Consider replacing these with
  `super.transferFrom(from, to, value);`, `super.transfer(to, value);`, `super.finishMinting();` and `super.mint(contributor, amount);` as any
  intermediate contract functions may be bypassed
  * [x] Updated in [58152e4](https://github.com/Privatix/smart-contract/commit/58152e4759a61c86448008376345aa72bc3cd4c6)
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** The expression `((hardCap / 1000) * 999)` in *Sale* should be rewritten as `((hardCap * 999) / 1000)` for more precision
  in the calculated result. See the following sample calculation

      pragma solidity ^0.4.16;

      contract Test {
          uint public hardCap = 57142e18;
          uint public calc1;
          uint public calc2;
    
          function Test() public {
              // Result 57142000000000000000000
              calc1 = ((hardCap / 1000) * 999);
              // Result 57084858000000000000000
              calc2 = hardCap * 999 / 1000;
          }
      }

  * [x] Fixed in [58152e4](https://github.com/Privatix/smart-contract/commit/58152e4759a61c86448008376345aa72bc3cd4c6)
* **MEDIUM IMPORTANCE** *Sale* and *Token* depend on the OpenZeppelin libraries, and the latest version of the OpenZeppelin libraries will
  be used when compiling the *Sale* and *Token* contracts for deployment. There are frequent changes to this library (last set of changes
  5d, 7d, 7d, 8d, 9d, 11d, 12d, 15d, 16d, ... ago). There is a risk that you may compile in partially tested changes. Consider hand-assembling
  the combined source code with a particular OpenZeppelin commit, testing with this version, and checking for further bug fix commits before
  deployment to mainnet. Or note what OpenZeppelin commit you are testing with, and review all new changes in OpenZeppelin before deployment
  to mainnet
  * [x] Developer has been made aware of this
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** In `Sale.updateStatus()` the bounty, team and founders allocations are calculated as 3%, 7% and 7% respectively. Say the
  totalSupply is 100, bounty%=3, team%=7, founders%=7. totalSupply after allocation is 100+3+7+7=117. bounty=3/117=2.56%, team=founders=7/117=
  5.98%. Is this 2.56%, 5.98% and 5.98% the intended distribution?
  * [x] Developer has updated the code in [58152e4](https://github.com/Privatix/smart-contract/commit/58152e4759a61c86448008376345aa72bc3cd4c6)
  * [ ] BK to confirm the calculations are correct
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** In `Sale.updateStatus()`, rewrite the expressions for the bounty, team and founders allocation calculations for more 
  precision. e.g. `bountyAvailable = token.totalSupply() / 100 * 3;` should be `bountyAvailable = (token.totalSupply() * 3) / 100;`.
  Multiplication before division
  * [x] Fixed in [58152e4](https://github.com/Privatix/smart-contract/commit/58152e4759a61c86448008376345aa72bc3cd4c6)
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** In *MultiOwners*, consider logging events when new owners are granted access, and existing owners are revoked access
  * [x] Added in [58152e4](https://github.com/Privatix/smart-contract/commit/58152e4759a61c86448008376345aa72bc3cd4c6)
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** As stated in the [ERC20 Token Standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20-token-standard.md#decimals),
  `decimals` should be defined as `uint8`
  * [x] Fixed in [58152e4](https://github.com/Privatix/smart-contract/commit/58152e4759a61c86448008376345aa72bc3cd4c6)
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** In *Token*, consider adding `bool _transferAllowed` to the `TransferAllowed(...)` event, removing the `if(...)` condition in
  `finishMinting(...)`, and logging the `_transferAllowed` value
  * [x] Updated in [58152e4](https://github.com/Privatix/smart-contract/commit/58152e4759a61c86448008376345aa72bc3cd4c6)
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** In *Token*, `mint(...)` can be called by anyone, but `MintableToken.mint(...)` will only allow the owner to execute
  `Token.mint(...)`. Just a small suggestion to add `onlyOwner` to `Token.mint(...)` to explicitly inform the readers of the source code
  that only the owner can execute this function
  * [x] Updated in [58152e4](https://github.com/Privatix/smart-contract/commit/58152e4759a61c86448008376345aa72bc3cd4c6)

### Second Review Recommendations

* **LOW IMPORTANCE** Consider updating the Solidity version number from `^0.4.11` and `^0.4.13` to a recent version
  * [x] Developer replied that they are planning to use
    [Solidity flattener](https://github.com/BlockCatIO/solidity-flattener/blob/master/src/solidity_flattener#L56) and
    the Solidity version in this tool is hard-coded to `^0.4.13`
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** The modifier `Sale.isStarted()` is not used. Consider removing this modifier
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** In `Sale.calcAmount(...)`, rewrite `return ((_value / weiPerToken) / 100) * rate;` as
  `return (_value * rate / weiPerToken) / 100;` for better precision
  * [x] Fixed in [609c861](https://github.com/Privatix/smart-contract/commit/609c86107087823ffd678bcc1fcebba917f79a51) 
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** Two `Transfer(0x0, ...)` events are logged for each minting event. `Token.mint(...)` emits one `Transfer(0x0, ...)` event and
  then calls `MintableToken.mint(...)` that also emits one `Transfer(0x0, ...)` event. `Token.mint(...)` can probably be removed as it does not
  add any functionality over `MintableToken.mint(...)`
